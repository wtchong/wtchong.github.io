<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second year Master student in Fudan University, under the supervision of [Prof. Dan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hgXRiG8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My main research interest is in computer vision, especially in the task of video object segmentation. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor degree in Guangxi University in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Ningjiang Chen.

At present, I am working as a research intern in Lenovo Research Institute, advised by [Kaer Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zh2ihGcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
